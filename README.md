## Mission

In many localities within the United States there are laws being passed which allow businesses to
reject business simply because of a religious belief. Though this has mostly been directed at members
of the LGBTQ community, the laws don't limit discrimination to just that subset of the population.
In order to help make minorities this application aims to keep track of businesses which have a track
of bigotry.
